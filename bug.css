The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be unexpected behavior if you use it incorrectly. Specifically, using `calc()` with multiple units without proper spacing can lead to errors.  For example, `width:calc(100%-20px);` is correct, while `width:calc(100%- 20px);` (note the extra space) will likely result in an unexpected width.  Another common issue is incorrect operator precedence, especially when combining multiplication and addition/subtraction.
